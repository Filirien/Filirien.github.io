                        <h2>History of BMW i8</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        The BMW i8, first introduced as the BMW Concept Vision Efficient Dynamics, is a plug-in hybrid sports car developed by BMW. The i8 is part of BMW's "Project i" and it is being marketed as a new brand, BMW i. The 2015 model year BMW i8 has a 7.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that delivers an all-electric range of 37 km (23 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cycle, the range in EV mode is 24 km (15 mi) with a small amount of gasoline consumption. The design is heavily influenced by the BMW M1 Hommage Concept (which is itself, a retro concept of the original M1).</br></br>
                        The BMW i8 can go from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 4.4 seconds and has a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). The BMW i8 has a fuel efficiency of 2.1 L/100 km (134.5 mpg‑imp; 112.0 mpg‑US) under the NEDC test with carbon emissions of 49 g/km. EPA rated the i8 combined fuel economy at 76 equivalent (MPG-equivalent) (3.1 L gasoline equivalent/100 km; 91 mpg-imp gasoline equivalent) and '29 miles per gallon' when running in pure gasoline mode (after the battery is drained empty).</br></br>
                        The initial turbodiesel concept car was unveiled at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany. The production version of the BMW i8 was unveiled at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The i8 was released in Germany in June 2014. Deliveries to retail customers in the U.S. began in August 2014. Global sales since mid-2014 totaled more than 10,000 BMW i8s by early November 2016, making the i8 the world's top selling plug-in electrified sports car. The top selling markets are the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany.
